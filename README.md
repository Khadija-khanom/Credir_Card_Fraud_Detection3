**Abstract Data Set for Credit Card Fraud Detection**
This dataset contains information related to credit card transactions, with a focus on fraud detection. The dataset has a total of 12 columns, each providing different attributes associated with credit card transactions. The goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on these attributes.

**Dataset Columns:**

**- Merchant_id:** An identifier for the merchant involved in the transaction.

**- Transaction date:** The date of the transaction. (Note: All entries in this column are missing values, so this column might not be useful for analysis.)

**- Average Amount/transaction/day:** The average amount of transactions made per day.

**- Transaction_amount:** The amount of the transaction.

**- Is declined:** Indicates whether the transaction was declined.

**- Total Number of declines/day:** The total number of transaction declines per day.

**- isForeignTransaction:** Indicates whether the transaction is a foreign transaction (made in a different country).

**- isHighRiskCountry:** Indicates whether the transaction involves a high-risk country.

**- Daily_chargeback_avg_amt:** The average amount of chargebacks per day.

**- 6_month_avg_chbk_amt:** The average chargeback amount over the last six months.

**- 6-month_chbk_freq:** The frequency of chargebacks over the last six months.

**- isFradulent:** The target variable, indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

**Data Characteristics:** 
• The dataset contains a total of 3075 entries (rows).

• Most columns have non-null values, except for the "Transaction date" column.

• The data types in the dataset include integers (int64), floating-point numbers (float64), and categorical values (object).
